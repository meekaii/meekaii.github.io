                The Bentota Turtle Hatchery Project is a popular attraction in Bentota for all travellers.
                 The pristine golden shores that draws people to its island, also provides an enticing nesting ground for 
                 several endangered turtle species from the Olive Ridley to the Leatherback turtle.
                  The project aims at conserving and protecting the eggs from predators and other dangers.

           <div class="darkbg">
           <p class="lightbg">
            Nesting Site Protection: The hatchery identifies and protects sea turtle nesting sites along the coastal areas of Bentota. 
            By monitoring these sites and implementing measures to safeguard the nests from disturbances and threats,
             the hatchery ensures a safe and conducive environment for nesting turtles.
           </p>
           <p class="lightbg">
            Incubation and Release: One of the primary activities at the hatchery is the collection of sea turtle eggs from nesting sites.
             These eggs are carefully incubated in controlled environments to maximize their hatching success. Once the hatchlings emerge, 
             the hatchery organizes regular releases,
             allowing visitors to witness and participate in the incredible journey of the baby turtles as they make their way into the ocean.
           </p>
           <p class="lightbg">
            Rescue and Rehabilitation: The hatchery provides a sanctuary for injured or sick sea turtles. 
            Skilled staff members and veterinarians offer medical 
            treatment and rehabilitation to these turtles, aiming to restore their health and eventually release them back into the wild.
           </p>

             sea turtles and the importance of their protection, inspiring them to become advocates for conservation.
           </p>
           <p class="lightbg">
            School Programs: The hatchery actively engages with local schools and educational institutions, conducting 
            interactive programs and workshops to educate students about sea turtle conservation. These programs aim to instill a sense of
